## Usage

To run the project, do `uv run main.py`. This inits the venv correctly so all
packages are installed for you.

## Setup
Installation:

```bash
sudo apt install -y ...
```

Make sure to run:

```bash
uv sync
uv venv --system-site-packages
```

When setting up. This allows the venv to see the local packages.

## Internal
We are going to measure pin 27 (BCM)
